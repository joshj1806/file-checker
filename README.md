# file-checker

  "A Linux directory structure contains 100G worth of files. The
	depth and number of sub-directories and files is not known.
         Soft-links and hard-links can also be expected.  Write, in
        the language of your choice, a program that traverses the
        whole structure as fast as possible and reports duplicate
        files. Duplicates are files with same content.
        Be prepared to discuss the strategy that you've taken and its trade-offs."

Please provide a quick documentation that briefly summarizes the following:
Design approach [ to as well state the ways how performance optimizations were considered and approached]
Expected Inputs/Outputs
Assumptions and known limitations with the delivered code
Summary on how to run the test client and its pre-requisites
